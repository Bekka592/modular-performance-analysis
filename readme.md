#### Seminar Paper about "Modular Performance Analysis using Real-Time Calculus"

Paper and presentation for the seminar "realtime theory" at Ulm University. Written in february 2021 during the 5th semester of my software engineering bachelor. The paper is largely based on the research of Ernesto Wandeler and Lothar Thiele. The Matlab code especially uses their [RTC Toolbox](https://www.mpa.ethz.ch/#mozTocId588080).
