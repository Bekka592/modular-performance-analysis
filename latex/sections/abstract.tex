The system-level analysis, and therefore the optimization of embedded real-time systems, plays an important role in the design process.
One way to perform such an analysis, is by using the powerful, yet simple, framework of modular performance analysis (\textbf{MPA}), which utilizes the formal analysis methods
of real-time calculus (\textbf{RTC}) to evaluate various performance criteria of hard real-time systems.
This analysis is done by building a system performance model, which sums up all the information, that is
needed for the following performance analysis.
In this paper an overview on RTC, MPA and their use is given and illustrated by a sample system.
